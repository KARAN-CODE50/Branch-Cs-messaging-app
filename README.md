## ABOUT 

In this project, i will address the challenge of handling a high volume of customer inquiries
while flagging the most urgent issues. The main objective is to build a simple messaging web
application for Branch that can scale with us as we grow our customer base.

1. Build a messaging web application that can be used to respond to incoming questions
sent by our customers. The system should allow a team of agents to respond to
incoming messages from (potentially many) customers in a streamlined fashion. Design
the system so that multiple agents can log in at the same time and respond to incoming
messages.

Installations - 
Install all libraries of node and npm so that functions can run in your system 

Extra features implemented : -
All basics features have been implemeted that have been sent by email 

and other features are -:

Make the agent UI (and/or the customer-facing UI) more interactive by leveraging
websockets or similar technology, so that new incoming messages can show up in real
time.

Implement search functionality to allow agents to search over incoming messages and /
or customers
